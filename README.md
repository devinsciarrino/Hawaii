Hawaii Short Term Rental Market Analysis


• Led a team of three in analyzing factors that most strongly correlate with high revenue for short term rentals across Hawaii with data from Insideairbnb.com.

• Performed data cleaning and feature engineering for revenue prediction models, developing a logistic regression baseline model and trained a random forest model that achieved an RMSE of 34.74 and an R² of 0.731.

• Built an interactive, user friendly Tableau dashboard that allowed clients to explore listings by location and filter by price, room count, rating, and other key variables.

• Researched and identified potential real estate and short term rental investors, initiated outreach, and secured meetings to present our findings and demonstrate the practical applications of our work.
